"""
A string u is a common subsequence of strings s and t if the symbols of u
appear in order as a subsequence of both s and t. For example, "ACTG" is a 
common subsequence of "AACCTTGG" and "ACACTGTGA".

Analogously to the definition of longest common substring, u is a longest 
common subsequence of s and t if there does not exist a longer common 
subsequence of the two strings. Continuing our above example, "ACCTTG" is a
longest common subsequence of "AACCTTGG" and "ACACTGTGA", as is "AACTGG".

Given: Two DNA strings s and t (each having length at most 1 kbp) in FASTA format.

Return: A longest common subsequence of s and t. (If more than one solution exists, 
you may return any one.)
