"""
A prefix of a length n string s is a substring s[1:j]; a suffix of s
is a substring s[k:n]. The failure array of s is an array P of length n
for which P[k] is the length of the longest substring s[j:k] that is equal 
to some prefix s[1:kâˆ’j+1], where j cannot equal 1 (otherwise, P[k] would
always equal k). By convention, P[1]=0.

Given: A DNA string s (of length at most 100 kbp) in FASTA format.
Return: The failure array of s.
